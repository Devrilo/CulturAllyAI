- [ ] Add E2E tests for event generation workflow
- [ ] Achieve 80% coverage on critical paths

### Medium Term (Month 1)
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Add visual regression testing
- [ ] Implement load testing with k6
- [ ] Add database testing with testcontainers

### Long Term (Month 2+)
- [ ] Add mutation testing
- [ ] Set up test reporting dashboard
- [ ] Implement continuous testing
- [ ] Regular accessibility audits

## 📊 Coverage Targets
