## ✅ Verification

Unit tests have been verified and are running successfully:

- ✓ 6 example tests passing
- ✓ React component testing working
- ✓ Mock functions working
- ✓ Setup file loaded correctly

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Write Tests**: Start adding tests for existing components and services
2. **Coverage Goals**: Aim for 80% coverage on validators and services
3. **E2E Tests**: Add end-to-end tests for critical user flows
4. **CI Integration**: Configure GitHub Actions to run tests on commits
5. **Page Objects**: Extend Page Object Models for all major pages

## 🎯 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Test validators in `src/lib/validators/`
- Test services in `src/lib/services/`
- Test custom hooks in `src/components/hooks/`
- Test utility functions in `src/lib/`

### E2E Tests

- Test authentication flows (login, register, logout)
- Test event generation workflow
- Test event management (view, edit, delete)
- Test settings and profile management
- Include accessibility checks on all pages

## 📚 Key Features

1. **80% Coverage Threshold**: Enforced for critical code paths
2. **Accessibility Testing**: Built-in with @axe-core/playwright
3. **Watch Mode**: Instant feedback during development
4. **Visual UI**: Vitest UI and Playwright UI for debugging
5. **Mocking**: MSW, Nock, and Vitest mocks for isolation
6. **Page Object Model**: Maintainable E2E test structure
7. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support in tests

## 🔧 Configuration Highlights

### Vitest

- JSdom environment for DOM testing
- Global test setup with common mocks
- Path aliases matching tsconfig.json
- Coverage exclusions for generated files

### Playwright

- Chromium-only configuration
- Automatic dev server startup
- Trace and screenshots on failure
- Parallel execution (disabled on CI)
